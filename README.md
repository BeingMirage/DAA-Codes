# 🧠 Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Lab Repository  

### 📘 Overview  
This repository contains **all practical programs and experiment codes** for the course:  
**Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** –  
_B.Tech. Computer Science & Engineering, Semester III_  
at **Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be University) College of Engineering, Pune**.  

Each experiment demonstrates the **implementation, analysis, and performance evaluation** of fundamental algorithms across multiple paradigms — sorting, searching, greedy, dynamic programming, divide & conquer, and backtracking.
